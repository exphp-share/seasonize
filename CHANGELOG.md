## v1.0.2 (unreleased)

- ECLplusLoader.exe is hitting Windows 10 virus detection (probably due to the DLL injection), so it has been removed from the distribution in favor of binhacks that automatically load ECLPLUS.dll.
- Spring should only cancel bullets during the first 15 frames.  Huh!

## v1.0.1 (2020-04-30)

- Fixed spring iframes being too short.
- Fixed spamming hyper cancels.

## v1.0.0 (2020-04-30)

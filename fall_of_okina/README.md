# `fall_of_okina` - The Fall of Okina Ex

**Exclusively for:** TH16

* **Enables Fall subseason** in the Extra stage.  (if you want this without the other changes, see the `subseason_fall` patch)
* Makes some adjustments to make a Full Spell run possible:
    * **Bombarmor is disabled** on all Okina Ex spells.
    * (This also inadvertently fixes the Dark Sarugaku bug)
    * Two spells are given **significantly reduced HP:** Reverse Invoker (the first spell), and Fire of Ena.
* **QoL:** Spell Practice begins with 1 season level, which what you'll usually have in the level.

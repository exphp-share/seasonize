    # god knows where for defeated spells/nonspells), overwriting the "max"
    # value stored in the EnemyDrop. Then in EnemyDrop::drop_ex it drops
    # that overwritten value.

    # However, it's much easier to just compute the bonus right before the
    # items are generated.  (My best guess as to why TH16 doesn't do this is
    # because EnemyDrop::drop_ex only has a pointer to the EnemyDrop and not
    # to the EnemyFull).
